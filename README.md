# matching-game
- This game is contained entirely inside the html file `matching-game.html`

### Running locally
- Running the game requires running the html file on a local server
    - One option: install "Live Server" extension for VS Code (may need to restart), right click the html file and do "Open with Live Server." If that doesn't work then google run html file on local.
